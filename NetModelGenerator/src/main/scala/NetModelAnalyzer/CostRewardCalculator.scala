/*
* The simulator computes random walks through the net graph thus simulating the behavior of the smartphone user.
* Every time a random walk is performed the simulator produces an instance of PATHRESULT that contains the
* list of nodes visited during the random walk and the list of edges traversed during the random walk.
* In addition, ModificationRecordInverse contains the list of modifications that were performed on the net graph
* so that it is possible for each node/edge in PATHRESULT to determine whether it was modified or not.
* While detecting some delta two key variables are updated: the target app score and the budget of the malapp.
* Each detected deviation from the "correct" net graph results in the decrease of target app score,
* and at the same time each step decreases the budget of the malapp. However, the PATHRESULT comes with the
* service reward that designates the usefulness of the malapp to the user. If the malapp is a true helpful app
* then it's useful fort the majority of the random walks earning high service award that compensates for the
* cost of detection.
* Service award should be proportional to the weights of the edges in a random walk. The higher the weight
* the more complexity there is to navigate the app and the more service should be provided to the user. Therefore,
* we computer the service award as the average of the weights of the edges in the random walk multiplied by the service award constant.
* This computed service award will be applied using the accept/reject mechanism of the service award probability.
